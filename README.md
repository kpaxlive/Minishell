# Minishell

A UNIX-like operating system shell program development project.

## Contribution

I developed a UNIX-like operating system shell program and allowed users to interpret entered
commands and run them using system calls.

## Skills

* C programming language
* UNIX system calls (fork, exec)
* Debugging techniques

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of Minishell from [here](https://github.com/kpaxlive/Minishell).
2. Extract the downloaded file and run the `make` command in the terminal.
3. Start Minishell by running the `./minishell` command.

## Usage

Minishell processes the commands entered by the user and displays the results. You can use the commands entered on the command line as follows:

`$ command [arguments]`

For example, you can use the following command to list the files in the current directory using the `ls` command:

`$ ls | grep minishell`
`$ cat main.c | grep if`

Or you can use following command to change the working directory using the `cd` command

`$ cd ..`

If you wanna exit just use "exit" command.
